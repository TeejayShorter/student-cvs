			<H1><ins><b> Personal Statement </b></ins></H1>
			<p> Teejay is a confident, determined individual who is passionate about technology and aspires to be part of a likeminded team of influential people that will help him to develop his skills. With Teejay's proficiency in graphic design and games development, he has built a strong sense for paying close attention to detail. This will occasionally help to flag some of the most acute inconsistencies but above all help with the quality of the projects that he works on. One skill you can rely upon Teejay for, is his ability to effectively communicate with anyone. This skill was refined from the years he spent working at different levels of retail - from casual assistant to a supervisor role - that ensured that he is able to effectively listen to delegated tasks as well as the ability to adeptly tell others how to perform their individual tasks. While managing a small team, Teejay ensured all delegated tasks were completed within the given time frame and that they were completed to the highest standard but ensured the team's morale and happiness were always one of the top priorities. </p>

				<p> Throughout working for Sports Direct, I have immersed myself heavily in customer service and ensuring the happiness of my co-workers. I have worked in multiple stores during my time and taken on more responsibility with each year of experience. My job has always been my passion and I have strived to make the department a better place. From doing this, I have gained some valuable skills such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Managing a team -</b> Delegating jobs, maintaining standards, providing order, covering shifts, dealing with lateness and providing weekly feedback to the store manager on the departments' situation</li>
					<li><b>Money Management -</b> Serving on the tills, counting up the floats at the end of the day as well as checking money discrepancies on the system for any overages</li>
					<li><b>Customer Service -</b> Helping customers to make correct choices with shoes, providing relevant information to customers in a non-technical manor and dealing with customer queries/complaints</li>
					<li><b>Merchandising -</b> Ensuring the products are displayed to the companies compliance standards</li>
				</ul>

Each doctor has a specialization and number of years working within that specialization that helped to determine which hospital they would be needed in for cover. The database ran queries that would help to show which doctors were free for temporary cover as well a being able to look for available doctors which specific skills and pay grades</td>

				<tr>
					<td>This project required recreating a 3D scaled model of the University so that the user is able to roam around the campus to see which resources and technology the university has on hand for students. This was to be for over-seas students to get a true feel of the size of the University and see everything it has to offer without having to travel for an induction day. It was designed using augmented reality techniques that show real world UI that would pop up throughout the world to show the information required.  To grant the full effect of the virtual reality, this application was designed to be used using the Oculus Rift. </td>

This was a short project that helped to use the WebGL framework and see the possibilities it gives web and software developers. This was all made using JavaScript (Three.js) in NetBeans</td>
